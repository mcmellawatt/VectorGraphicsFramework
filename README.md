# VectorGraphicsFramework
A framework for generating vector graphics using XML as input and bitmaps as output.  It also has the ability to load bitmaps and apply transformations.  It uses a pipe and filter type architecture, and implements the decorator and iterator design patterns.

This was the final project for the University of Washington Certificate in C++ program.
